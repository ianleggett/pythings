First project:
1. Get minute bars working for FX and use zipline for back testing.
2. Create a series of synthetic instruments based on 30, 50 90, 120 minute momentum prices [see here for example](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/algorithmic-trading-in-less-than-100-lines-of-python-code?imm_mid=0ed016&cmp=em-na-na-na-newsltr_fintech_20170206)
3. Take Markowitz portfolio optimiser and apply it to all instruments including sythetics
4. Run every period(x) trade!
